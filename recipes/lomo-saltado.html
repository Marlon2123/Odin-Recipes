    <p>
      Lomo saltado is a classic dish of Peruvian cuisine. It is a stir-fry of
      beef with vegetables, french fries, and white rice. The beef is cut into
      thin strips and marinated in garlic, salt, and pepper. It is then
      stir-fried in a wok or large skillet with hot oil until browned on all
      sides. Vegetables, such as onion, tomato, and yellow aji pepper, are added
      and cooked for a few minutes more. Finally, soy sauce, vinegar, and beef
      broth are added, and the mixture is cooked until the sauce thickens
      slightly. It is served with french fries and white rice.
